**Neon** is a serverless PostgreSQL database that simplifies database management with flexible scalability. To use Neon with **Galsenext**, follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A `Neon` account. If you don't have an account yet, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech).

## Creating and Configuring the Database

### 1. Create a Database on Neon

       1. Log in to your Neon account.
       2. In the Neon dashboard, click on `Create Database`.
       3. Give your database a name and select the deployment region that suits you.
       4. Click on Create to create your database.

### 2. Obtain Connection Information

Once your database is created, you will need several details to configure your project:

- **DATABASE_URL**: The connection URL for your database. You can find it in your database settings on Neon.

Here is an example of a connection URL:

```bash
postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database
```

### 3. Configure Your `.env` File

Add your Neon database connection information to your `.env` file at the root of your project. Here is an example configuration:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database
```

## Example of Connecting to Neon with Prisma

Ensure that the `prisma/schema.prisma` file uses the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to connect to your `Neon` database:

```bash
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

## Important Points

- **Check Connection Information**: Ensure that the connection URL is correct and that the information is up-to-date in your `.env` file.
- **Consult Neon Documentation**: For more details on configuring and using `Neon`, refer to the [official Neon documentation](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues or other errors related to Neon, here are some troubleshooting steps:

- **Check the Connection URL**: Make sure the connection URL in the `.env` file is correct.
- **Test the Connection**: Use a `PostgreSQL` client to test the connection to the database with the provided information.
- **Check Logs**: Review your application's and `Neon`'s logs for error messages that might provide clues about the issues encountered.
