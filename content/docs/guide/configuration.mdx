# Configuration

After installing **Galsenext**, follow these steps to properly configure your development environment.

## Configuration of the `.env` File

To ensure your application runs correctly, you need to create a `.env` file at the root of your project and define several environment variables. Here is an example of a basic configuration:

```plaintext
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
```

## GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET:

- **What it is**: OAuth 2.0 credentials used for authentication via Google.
- **Purpose**: Allows users to log in to your application using their Google account.
- **How to obtain**: Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com), enable the "OAuth 2.0" API, and generate OAuth credentials.

## NEXTAUTH_URL:

- **What it is**: The URL of your application.
- **Purpose**: Used by NextAuth to define the primary domain of the application. This URL is crucial for handling redirects after authentication.
- **How to set it**: For local development, use **http://localhost:3000**. In production, use your site's URL, e.g., **https://yoursite.com**.

## NEXTAUTH_SECRET:

- **What it is**: A secret key used to sign and encrypt NextAuth session tokens.
- **Purpose**: Ensures the security of sessions and authentication data for your application.
- **How to generate**: Use the following command in your terminal to generate a secure key:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## DATABASE_URL:

- **What it is**: The connection URL to your PostgreSQL database.
- **Purpose**: Allows Prisma and your application to interact with the database.
- **How to configure**:
  - Create a database on [Neon](https://neon.tech).
  - Retrieve the connection URL (format `postgres://user:password@hostname:port/database`) and set it in your **.env** file.
