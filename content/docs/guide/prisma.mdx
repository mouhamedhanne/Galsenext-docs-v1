# Prisma Configuration

**Galsenext** uses `Prisma` as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database. `Prisma` simplifies data management and interaction with your `PostgreSQL` database.

## Prisma Instance Configuration

In **Galsenext**, Prisma is configured to operate optimally both in development and production modes. The `prisma.ts` file located in the `/src/lib/` directory is configured to create a unique instance of Prisma that is reused throughout the application, optimizing performance and minimizing database connection issues.

```bash
// @ts-nocheck

import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

export const prisma: PrismaClient =
  global.prisma ??
  new PrismaClient({
    log:
      process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
        ? ["query", "error", "warn"]
        : ["error"],
  });

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  global.prisma = prisma;
}
```

- **Creating a Single Instance of Prisma**: The Prisma instance is stored in the global variable `global.prisma` to prevent multiple instances from being created in a development environment, which could cause database connection errors. This approach is particularly useful with `Next.js`, which uses an automatic module refresh system in development mode.
- **Prisma Logs Configuration**: In development mode (`process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"`), Prisma is configured to display query, error, and warning logs (`["query", "error", "warn"]`). In production, only error logs are enabled (`["error"]`) to avoid exposing sensitive information.
- **Environment Check**: The code checks if the environment is not in production (`process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`). If so, it assigns the Prisma instance to `global.prisma` to ensure that only one instance is used throughout the application's lifecycle.

## Initial Prisma Setup

The Prisma schema file `prisma/schema.prisma` is already configured for basic authentication. Here’s how to configure and use Prisma:

### 1. Initializing Prisma

When you have installed Galsenext, `Prisma` is already included. You need to set up your database by following these steps:

#### Database Migration

To apply the Prisma schema to your database, run the following command:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This command will create the necessary tables for authentication and prepare your database.

### 2. Modifying the Prisma Schema

The default `schema` is sufficient to handle **authentication**. However, you can modify this file according to your needs. For example, if you want to add models for specific features, edit the `prisma/schema.prisma` file:

```bash
model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

#### Applying Changes

After modifying the `schema.prisma` file, you need to run a new migration to apply these changes to your database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-post-model
```

This command will update the database by adding the new model or applying other changes you've made to the schema.

### Points to Check

- **Check the Configuration**: Ensure that the `.env` file contains the correct information to connect to your database [see Environment Variables Configuration](https://galsenext-docs.vercel.app/docs/guide/configuration#configuration-du-fichier-env).
- **Refer to Prisma Documentation**: For more details on using `Prisma` and its advanced features, consult the [official Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs).
