First, go to [the create school page](https://codeline.app/schools/start) where you will be able to create a school.

If you are not logged in, please create an account. Using GitHub or Google is easier and faster.

### Creating Your School

When you are on the page, you will be asked to fill in:

1. `Name`: The name of your school.
2. `Identifier`: Keep it simple, short, and easy to remember. It will be used in all URLs.
3. `Contact email`: This will be used for your Stripe billing and invoicing.

**ℹ️ While in beta, everything is free.**

## Link Your Stripe Account

If you want to sell your courses and start making money, you'll need to go to the [School's Settings](http://localhost:3000/admin/schools) page and click on "Connect Stripe".

After that, you will follow the [Stripe Connect Process](TODO LINK) until the end.

Please **finish the process**.

When it's finished: ✨ all done ✨

You can now start creating your first courses.
