After creating your school, you can start by creating your first courses.

import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

<Callout title="What is a course?">

A course is a collection of sections and lessons. It can be a class, a workshop, training, etc.

The objective is to create private courses that people pay to access.

In Codeline, a `course` is named a `Product`.

## Create Your First Course

Go to [the product page](https://codeline.app/admin/products) and click on `Create Product`.

You will need to choose:

- `Title`: The title of your course.
- `Slug`: A unique identifier for your course. It will be used in all URLs.

Then you will be redirected to the `Settings` page.

Here you can edit the description, images, banner, and pricing.

<img src="/courses-card.png" alt="Course card" width="500" />

You can edit the information later.

### Content

In the sidebar, you can find a menu `Content` where you can edit the content of your courses.

<img src="/courses-content.png" alt="Course content" width="500" />

You will be redirected to the "Editor" where you can edit lessons and sections.
